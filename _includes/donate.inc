This site contains a lot of words. If you printed the PDF of it out, it would be about 2000 pages (and by the way, if you do want to read it offline, you can get the e-book [here](/books/)). I want to keep this site ad-free, so if you find the content useful, please donate the price of a few beers to help keep it up.
